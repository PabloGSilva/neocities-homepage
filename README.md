# neocities-homepage

This repository contains the code for my personal Neocities website, that serves as a hub page for all my musical projects.

You can find it over at https://pablocolcheias.neocities.org/

## Technologies

- HTML / CSS / Javascript
- Matter.JS

## How to run

It is a static website, so simply downloading the files and running ``index.html`` on a web browser should do the trick.
