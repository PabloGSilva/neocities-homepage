            <h1>Who the hell is Pablo Silva?</h1>
            <p>I'm your local internet musician. I'd guess the main quirk that makes me stick out as an artist is the
                sheer range of musical styles i embark on. What else could you expect from a Ween fan?</p>
            <p>Feel free to check out my "jukebox" page and explore the records i have released so far.</p>
            <br>
            <h1>Cool slogans... but who actually are you?</h1>
            <p>Well, my name is <i>Pablo A. G. Silva Jr.</i>, and i am a <label id="ageLabel">[Loading
                    age...]</label> year old <label style="font-size: 0.5em;"><i>[July 1st 2004]</i></label> latino
                chico from São Paulo -
                Brazil. That only really on paper, really, since i moved to the
                city of Garça when i was about 4 years old. Well, i currently work as a software developer and I have a
                degree in systems development from the FATEC Technology College in Garça.
            </p>
            <p>I have developed a passion for music over the years, which sparkled off my step-father introducing me to
                Pink Floyd's <i>"Comfortably Numb"</i>. Safe to say that my mind was blown at that moment, and music
                never felt more intense before. Eventually i got into all the cool classic rock bands, y'know, The
                Beatles, The Doors, Zeppelin, etc. Since then my musical taste has morphed into a hybrid between the
                frantic extreme punk of Orchid's <i>"I Am Nietzsche"</i> to the beautiful aquatic soundscapes of Hiroshi
                Yoshimura's <i>"Wet Land"</i>, with some Chappell Roan thrown in the rotation too. So yeah i am an
                autistic little brat about anything music, even the least musical sounding records you can find.</p>
            <p>I'm also an enthusiast of topics like tech development, history, politics, cinema, gaming...</p>
            <p>Trust me, when the socialist revolution starts i'll be there on the front lines hehehe.</p>
